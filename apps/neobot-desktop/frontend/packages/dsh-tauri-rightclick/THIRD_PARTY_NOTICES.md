- Not copied: the native-style context menu is this repo's own feature; where an action exists officially it is delegated to the official implementation first, with the plugin's own path as fallback.

Integration points:

- Official primitives popovers: menus and toasts run on the official primitives `Menu`; the plugin adds host capabilities and extra items (`src/client/register/context-menu.tsx:46`), and shortcut hints reuse the official menu item shape that accepts `ReactNode` (`context-menu.tsx:32`).
- Official actions first: rename, archive and fork call the official implementation with the service instance as receiver and fall back only when unavailable (`src/client/service/menu.ts:43,63,102,111`); pinning is offered only when the kernel provides it (0.1.7+), older kernels hide the entry (`menu.ts:77,90`).
- Official menu/row location: menu items and inline row action buttons are located through their official text and ARIA shape (`src/client/register/official-menu.ts:8`, `src/client/register/locate.ts:40,107`), including the official React-rendered action button that appears after hover.
- Official service surface: `src/client/types/index.ts:21,29,33` extends the official sessions / workspaces services with the capabilities this menu needs (`open` was removed in kernel 0.1.7 and is restored by the adapter compat bridge; the pinned-session set exists from 0.1.7).

## deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness

- Repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- Version: `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2`
- Revision: `639ed015397290b3745d163aafe02ffee4aa3f84`
- Source: `source/deepseek-harness`
- Catalog pin: `dsh:` → `0.2.0-rc.2` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- License: MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek
- Not copied: the per-turn Git snapshot and file restore path are this repo's own; only the input-dock chip mirrors the official deliverables row.

Mirrored official surface:

- Chip form and position: the "N files changed +x -y" chip reproduces the official deliverables row and disappears when the turn ends (`src/client/components/running-changes-chip.cssr.ts:7`).
- Count colours: `+N` green / `-M` red match the official deliverables row (`src/client/components/change-counts.tsx:5`, `src/client/styles/counts.cssr.ts:8`, `src/client/components/running-changes-chip.cssr.test.ts:26`).
- Dock order: the chip is ordered against the official dock rows (official `todo` = 0, `goal` = 10, `queue` = 20, worktree banner = -10); a negative order places it above the official task list and worktree banner (`src/client/constants/index.ts:12`, `src/client/register/running-chip.ts:5`).
- Official reference chips (`ctx.conversation.input` insertion path) → `src/client/register/paste-collapse.ts`: large pastes collapse into the official reference chip through the official public surface only.

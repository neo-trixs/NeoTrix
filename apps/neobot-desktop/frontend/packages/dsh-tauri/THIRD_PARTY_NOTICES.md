Derived (upstream → this package):

- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts` — `platformLoginUrl()`, `welcomeBackend.account.watch(...)`, `shell.openExternal(...)` while `attempt.phase === 'waiting-browser'` → `src/client/register/account.ts`: the watch → open flow, run in the embedded UI and opened through the shell's `open_external_url`.
- `packages/client/ui-settings-account/src/client/index.ts` — `ctx.remote.$stream({ name: 'account', open: signal => ctx.remote.account.watch(signal) })` consuming `frame.value` / `frame.accept()`, gated by `'dshDesktop' in globalThis` → `src/client/register/account.ts`: the account-stream consumption pattern and carrier gate.
- `apps/desktop/src/preload-app.ts` — `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('dshDesktop', <app origin> ? createProductApi() : { protocolVersion: 1 })` → `src/host/apply.ts`: the carrier marker; `protocolVersion: 1` plus `deviceInfo()` returning `navigator.userAgent` are published, no Electron product API (`browser`, `updates`) is faked.
- `packages/host/webserver` — structured index-injection rows (`global`, `script`, `script-src`, …) → `src/host/types/harness.ts` (`IndexInjectRow`; upstream exports the same union as `IndexInjection`).
- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts` — `app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('dsh')` + `open-url` handling that focuses the primary window for `dsh://open` → `src-tauri/src/desktop/deep_link.rs` (app shell).

Not derived:

- `src/host/service/gate.ts` adapts this repo's embedded-WebView authentication constraints; upstream only defines the `connection` gate semantics it overrides.

Note:

- The account-stream carrier gate and the sidebar/DOM contracts mirrored here survived `0.2.0-rc.1` → `0.2.0-rc.2` unchanged; `dshDesktop` still reports `protocolVersion: 1` with the optional `deviceInfo` member, and `DESKTOP_HOST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` stays `4`.

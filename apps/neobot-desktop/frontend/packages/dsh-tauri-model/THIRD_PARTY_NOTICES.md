Derived (upstream `packages/client/ui-settings-models/` → this package `src/`):

- `src/index.ts` → `host/apply.ts`
- `src/onboarding-config.ts`, `src/onboarding-copy.ts` → `shared/onboarding-config.ts`, `shared/onboarding-copy.ts`
- `src/client/index.ts` → `client/register/models.ts`, `client/index.ts`
- `src/client/ModelsSection.tsx` → `client/models/ModelsSection.tsx`
- `src/client/DeepSeekModelsEditor.tsx` → `client/models/DeepSeekModelsEditor.tsx`
- `src/client/DeepSeekOnboardingDialog.tsx` → `client/models/DeepSeekOnboardingDialog.tsx`
- `src/client/ProviderEditor.tsx` → `client/models/ProviderEditor.tsx`
- `src/client/CustomProviderCard.tsx` → `client/models/CustomProviderCard.tsx`
- `src/client/ModelListEditor.tsx`, `ModelRow.tsx`, `ModelInputTypes.tsx`, `EditorFooter.tsx` → `client/models/` (same names)
- `src/client/OnboardingModal.tsx`, `WelcomeNotice.tsx` → `client/models/` (same names)
- `src/client/apiKey.ts`, `protocol-label.ts`, `operations.ts`, `schema-operations.ts`, `slot-contract.ts`, `store.ts`, `welcome-store.ts`, `locales.ts` → `client/models/` (same names)

Synced `0.2.0-rc.1` → `0.2.0-rc.2`:

- `ui-settings-models/` — this package's derived source — carries no code change across the range; only its `package.json` version string moves.
- The release's third-party model-catalog and compatibility refresh (`pi-ai` 0.87.1) needs nothing here: no `pi-ai` compat field is named in this package (`deferredToolsMode`, `supportsToolReferences`, `supportsMidConvo*`, `sessionAffinityFormat`, `mistral-conversations` are all absent), `model-compat.ts` keeps writing `thinkingFormat` / `chatTemplateKwargs` / `supportsDeveloperRole`, and the preset catalog is sourced from the live LiteLLM index instead of `pi-ai`'s bundled model ids.
- `ModelListEditor.tsx`: the fetched-model picker takes the release's model-picker search posture. `rankByName` from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives` replaces the substring filter, and the search field gains ArrowUp / ArrowDown (wrapping), Home / End, Enter to toggle the active row, and Escape to close, with the active row scrolled into view and highlighted.

Synced `0.1.7-alpha.1` → `0.1.7-rc.2`:

- `store.ts`: the account route (`deepseek-account`) is joined out of the credential space — no `apiKeyEnv`, no credential read, availability from `session/modelCatalog()`; hidden while signed out; `providerUsable` answers through `accountAvailable`.
- `store.ts`: account and official routes sort first, in that order.
- `ModelsSection.tsx`: `needsSetup` never renders the account row as a setup card; the account row shows the localized `deepSeekAccount` name; the delete dialog's initial focus moves to `data-modal-autofocus`.
- `ProviderEditor.tsx` / `CustomProviderCard.tsx`: the account route edits only its model catalog (no key field, no credential describe); every key input uses `autoComplete="new-password"`.
- `ModelListEditor.tsx`: candidate ids carry `title={name ?? id}`.
- `register/models.ts` + `client/index.ts`: `remote.session` joins the inject list; `credentials/record-updated` refreshes the page; the internal-testing notice step is no longer registered on the desktop carrier.
- `styles.ts`: the upstream CSS token migration (radius scale, settings-card fill and stroke, focus-ring token, business-state ink) plus the candidate-id ellipsis.

Kept from upstream:

- The slot and remote contracts are unchanged: `settings.section`, `settings.onboarding`, `settings.models.sign-in`, the `llm-deepseek` settings namespace, and the `credentialOnboarding` gate published through the `webserver/index-inject` global.
- The `'dshDesktop' in globalThis` precondition of the official credential onboarding is preserved, so the local API-key flow never competes with the official account flow.
- The DeepSeek credential-onboarding step stays registered on the desktop carrier (upstream registers it there too); only its automatic posture is gated.

Re-implemented instead of copied:

- Styling runs on this repo's `css-render` stack (`client/models/styles.ts`, `client/models/styles.overrides.ts`); upstream `.module.css` files are not copied.
- `client/register/styles.ts`, `client/models/remote.ts`, `client/models/settings-forms.ts`, `client/types/remotes.ts`, `client/constants/index.ts` are this repo's own glue.

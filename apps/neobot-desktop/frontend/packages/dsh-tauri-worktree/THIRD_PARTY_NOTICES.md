## deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness

- Repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- Version: `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2`
- Revision: `639ed015397290b3745d163aafe02ffee4aa3f84`
- Source: `source/deepseek-harness`
- Catalog pin: `dsh:` → `0.2.0-rc.2` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- License: MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek
- Not copied: the per-session Git worktree is this repo's own feature; only the official Host and client contracts below are relied on.

Integration points:

- Official session title: `sessionTitle.refresh()` is the explicit entry point when the kernel's automatic title generation did not run, right after the first request header lands; its absence or failure never affects the task (`src/host/service/title.ts:21`, `src/host/events/session-event.ts:9`).
- Official attachments service: attachment descriptors are handed back to the official collection, and a missing capability only falls back, never blocks (`src/client/service/attachments.ts:5`, `src/client/service/attachments.test.ts:115`).
- Official composer DOM: send interception depends on the official composer's private DOM because no pre-submit hook exists (`src/client/components/mode-select.tsx:104`); file uploads wait for readiness exactly as the official composer disables send while it is not ready.
- Ordinary session titles: refreshed once per session via the official entry, matching the kernel's own timing.

- Repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- Version: `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2`
- Revision: `639ed015397290b3745d163aafe02ffee4aa3f84`
- Source: `source/deepseek-harness`
- Catalog pin: `dsh:` → `0.2.0-rc.2` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- License: MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek
- Not copied: a Tauri-flavoured refork of the official client UI — official components are re-exported as-is where both kernel generations agree, reforked locally where only the newer kernel implements or exports them; no official source file is vendored.

Derived (upstream → this package):

- `packages/client/ui-primitives/src/` (version `0.1.7-alpha.1`, ≥ `0.1.5-rc.1`) → `src/client/components/official.tsx`: pass-through re-export of `Button`, `Switch`, `Tag`, `Pill`, `Menu`, `Input`, `Tooltip`, `Toast`, `Modal`, `HoverCard`, `DisclosureRow`, `StateDot`, `ConnectionIndicator`, `BrandWordmark`, `FishLogo`; `Button` / `Tag` are taken over per-variant by `button.tsx` / `tag.tsx` (official variant → official implementation, local variant → refork style).
- `packages/client/ui-primitives/src/` icons barrel → deliberately not re-exported (export names differ between kernel generations).
- `packages/client/ui-plugin-manager/src/client/PluginManagerPage.module.css` → `src/client/ui/panel-page.cssr.ts`, `src/client/ui/panel-page.tsx`: the plugin panel is laid out line-by-line on the official plugin page geometry.
- `packages/client/ui-sidebar`, `ui-workspace`, `ui-chat`, `ui-settings-models`, `ui-agent-preset`, `ui-permission-presets`, `ui-goal` CSS Modules → `src/client/components/registry.ts` (`UI_COMPONENT_REGISTRY`, `kind: 'reexport' | 'refork'`, `mappedClass`) plus `src/client/components/*.cssr.ts`: reforked geometry and official class mapping on this repo's `css-render` stack; official `.module.css` files are not copied.
- Official sidebar branding row and its collapse toggle → `src/client/styles/global.cssr.ts`: hiding rule for the duplicated official entry, keyed off the official class shape (`clsx(brand, wide)`) and `aria-label` dictionaries instead of hashed class names.
- Official slot `conversation.hero.workspace` (single/root, declared by `ui-workspace`, official `WorkspacePicker` at default priority) → `src/client/register/hero-workspace.ts`, `src/client/ui/hero-workspace.*`: takeover at a lower priority so the official registration stays in place; the official `WorkspacePickFlow` "add workspace" item id is reused verbatim.
- Official settings launcher seat (`ui-settings-general` `SettingsRoot` rendering the account menu) → `src/client/constants/index.ts` (`SETTINGS_TRIGGER_PRIORITY`), `src/client/ui/settings-trigger.tsx`: seat takeover keeping a host for the official account UI, plus the official dictionary strings for the sidebar "new session" button and the ungrouped workspace-group `+` (`new-session.utils.ts`, official `UNGROUPED_KEY`).
- Official primitives variants `PermissionRow.selector`, `PermissionSelect`, `AgentPresetSeat` → `src/client/components/chip.tsx`: per-variant wrapping and the official `@container` query that `css-render` can only emit as a top-level raw rule.

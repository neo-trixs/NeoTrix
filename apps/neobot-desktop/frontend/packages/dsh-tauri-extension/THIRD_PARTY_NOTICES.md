## deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness

- Repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- Version: `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2`
- Revision: `639ed015397290b3745d163aafe02ffee4aa3f84`
- Source: `source/deepseek-harness`
- Catalog pin: `dsh:` → `0.2.0-rc.2` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- License: MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek
- Not copied: the manager drives the official Host plugins instead of re-implementing them.

Official contracts used:

- Skills provider: `src/host/service/provider.utils.ts` imports the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill-filesystem` through the platform loader; `src/host/service/provider.ts` re-mounts it with `customSkillDirs` = packaged `skills/` + managed skill roots + agent roots.
- Skill policy: `src/host/routes/skill/policy/post.ts` calls the official `setPolicy(path, enabled)`.
- Skill format and roots: `SKILL.md` directory bundle or flat `<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter, in the official project/custom/user priority order, including the official `user-dsh` root `<DSH_HOME>/skills`.
- MCP: every `cordis.patch.yml` row is an official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` instance (`MCP_PLUGIN` in `src/host/config/constants.ts`) using the official `serverName` / `transport` / `command` / `args` / `env` / `cwd` or `url` / `headers` shape.
- MCP config subset: the official `toolCallTimeoutMs`, `failOnStartupError`, `maxInstructionBytes` and `reconnect` keys are not surfaced yet.
- MCP resources: left to the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-resources`; this package adds no resource tooling.

- Repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- Version: `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2`
- Revision: `639ed015397290b3745d163aafe02ffee4aa3f84`
- Source: `source/deepseek-harness`
- Catalog pin: `dsh:` → `0.2.0-rc.2` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- License: MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek
- Not copied: a development-only playground that renders the component registry of `dsh-tauri-ui`, so it shows — but does not copy — official client UI components.

Official surface referenced:

- Registry semantics: the `reexport` (official implementation forwarded as is, styles from the official CSS Modules) and `refork` (official CSS reproduced locally because only the newer kernel implements or exports the component) distinctions, including the official class each refork maps to (`src/client/ui/components-playground/ui-components.tsx:112,128-130,252`).
- Official `Menu`: wired into the chip triggers so selection state, chevron rotation and popover placement behave like the shipped UI (`ui-components.tsx:57`).
- Icons: two kernel generations export the official icons barrel under different names, so icons are consumed through `@gravity-ui/icons` re-exported by `dsh-tauri-ui/client` (`ui-components.tsx:262`).
- Derivation table of those official components: `packages/dsh-tauri-ui/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

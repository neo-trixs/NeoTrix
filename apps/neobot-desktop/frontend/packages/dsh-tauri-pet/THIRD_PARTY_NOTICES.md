## deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness

- Repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- Version: `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2`
- Revision: `639ed015397290b3745d163aafe02ffee4aa3f84`
- Source: `source/deepseek-harness`
- License: MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek
- Not copied: the plugin mounts an official provider and consumes official client contracts.

Integration points:

- Skill provider instance: `cordis.patch.yml` inserts an official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill-filesystem` as row `dsh-tauri-pet-skills` (`providerName: dsh-tauri-pet`, `includeDefaultRoots: false`, `customSkillDirs` → this package's bundled `skills/`).
- Settings entry: clone of the official account menu entry inside the official primitives `Menu` (`src/client/constants/index.ts:37-39`, `src/client/register/settings-menu.utils.ts:24-33`, `src/client/register/settings-menu.ts:16-19`); styling inherited, no generated CSS-module hash hard-coded.
- Client services: official projections are read, not forked — `workspaces.list` and the official new-session target order (`src/client/service/pet.utils.ts:3,21`); declared client contracts `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-layout`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-renderer`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-slots`.

## PC2005-cloud/dsh-pet

- Repository: <https://github.com/PC2005-cloud/dsh-pet>
- Asset pin: `e1ff8c1e4001878cbb80441262d530e16541f138`
- License: MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 PC2005-cloud
- Streaming only: the pet media assets (WebM animations, preview GIFs, `config.jsonc`) are not bundled or downloaded; `pets.built-in` in `src-tauri/resources/manifest.jsonc` registers the remote URLs and the pet window streams them at play time.

## dsh-tauri-desk/dsh-pet-mov

- Repository: <https://github.com/dsh-tauri-desk/dsh-pet-mov>
- Asset pin: `be0f3bb494cb71a4c73f916c0b92d25a3ab4d002`
- License: MIT
- Used: macOS reads this HEVC-alpha `.mov` mirror; it is our own re-encode of the upstream transparent WebM clips and carries no separate artwork.

## References (nothing shipped)

- `QCYTSN/dsh-dafeiyu`: referenced for text and status-priority behaviour only; no sprite or `legacy/` assets are bundled, downloaded or redistributed (see [`docs/sync-log.md`](./docs/sync-log.md)). Its own art was replaced upstream in `v0.1.10` by assets imported from `PC2005-cloud/dsh-pet`.

## deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness

- Repository: <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- Version: `dsh-v0.2.0-rc.2`
- Revision: `639ed015397290b3745d163aafe02ffee4aa3f84`
- Source: `source/deepseek-harness`
- Catalog pin: `dsh:` → `0.2.0-rc.2` (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- License: MIT — Copyright (c) 2026 DeepSeek
- Not copied: the official workspace browser and settings sidebar are extended through official slots, official primitives `Menu` entries and the official sessions / workspaces service surfaces.

Integration points:

- Archive entry: the official primitives menu item for "delete workspace" is cloned into an "archive workspace" entry inserted before it, the official item staying at the bottom (`src/client/register/workspace-patch.tsx:25-29`, `src/client/register/workspace-patch.utils.ts:52,63-64`); the official danger styling is overridden to a neutral menu item via a plugin attribute hook plus `!important` (`src/client/styles/workspace-menu.cssr.ts:6`).
- Official row/menu recognition: only official `itemWrap`-structured primitives entries are recognised, and workspace rows are matched by the official row title (`workspace-patch.utils.ts:13,32,52`).
- Official service surface: `src/client/types/runtime.ts:24-29` declares the official sessions (list subscription, refresh, open, bind, fork) and workspaces surfaces; `open` moved in kernel 0.1.7 and is restored by this repo's adapter instead of being re-implemented.
- Official archive action mirroring: a session archived through the official menu appears in this package's page immediately (`src/client/hooks/use-archive-view.ts:15`).

Deliberate difference:

- The official entry only unarchives; this package's "Archived chats" page adds search, sort, grouping, project filter, delete, and a "delete workspace" action rewritten into "archive workspace".
